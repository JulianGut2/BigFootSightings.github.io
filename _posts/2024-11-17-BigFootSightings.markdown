<h1> Bigfoot Sightings Across the United States (Most to Least) </h1>

{% include bar_chart.html %}

<p> In this chart I chose to visualize on a bar chart the number of how many accounts of big foot sightings
there have been by state, and have sorted them from most to least. I specifically chose a bar chart as I believed that this was the easiest way to show visually the amount of sightings and can allow a person to look at each state to see where they stand in terms of sightings. I decided to keep it simple visually, using the states as the Y axis and the number of sightings on the X axis, with varying colors for each bar. The point really was to just order the states numberically by sightings. For this data, I really did not have to do any data transformations or cleaning, All I verified was to make sure that there were no instances in the state column where a result would be null, in which there were no instances making this visualization bery basic, and quick.</p>
